# Building a resilient IaaS architecture before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure Subscription

- LabVM virtual machine deployed using the instructions below. The VM is pre-installed with various tools and files you will use during this lab.

- Contoso sample application, also deployed using the instructions below.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 25 minutes

In this exercise, you deploy a Lab VM needed to complete the rest of your lab.

### Task 1: Create the LabVM Virtual Machine

In this task, you will use an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy the LabVM virtual machine. This machine will be pre-configured with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, has Azure PowerShell pre-installed, and is pre-loaded with any additional files which you will use during the lab.

1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button below to open the Azure portal and launch the template deployment for the LabVM. Log in to the Azure portal using your subscription credentials if prompted to do so.

    [![Button to deploy the LabVM template to Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton "Deploy the LabVM template to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Building-a-resilient-IaaS-architecture%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2FResources%2Ftemplates%2Flab-vm.json)

    > **Note**: If you attempt to deploy the template above and it fails, stating "requested size for resource *\<resourceID\>* is currently not available in location", you can choose a different VM size from the first screen of the deployment. 

2. Complete the Custom deployment blade as follows:

    - Resource Group: **(Create new) LabRG**
  
    - Location: **Choose a location close to you**.

    Select **Review + Create** and then **Create** to deploy the resources.

    You should proceed to the next task **without** waiting for the deployment to complete to save time. The deployment can take up to 30 minutes to deploy the resources.

### Task 2: Deploy the Contoso sample application

In this task, you will use an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy the Contoso sample application, which you will use in this lab.

1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button below to open the Azure portal and launch the template deployment for the Contoso sample application. Log in to the Azure portal using your subscription credentials if prompted to do so.

    [![Button to deploy the Contoso sample application template to Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton "Deploy the Contoso sample application template to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Building-a-resilient-IaaS-architecture%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2FResources%2Ftemplates%2Fcontoso-iaas.json)

    > **Note**: If you attempt to deploy the template above and it fails, stating "requested size for resource *\<resourceID\>* is currently not available in location", you can choose a different VM size from the first screen of the deployment.

2. Complete the Custom deployment blade as follows:

    - Resource Group: **(Create new) ContosoRG1**
    - Location: **Choose a location close to you**

    Select **Review + Create** and then **Create** to deploy the resources. It usually takes around 20 minutes to deploy the resources.

### Task 3: Wait for deployments to complete, and validate

In this task, you will verify that the LabVM and Contoso sample application have been deployed successfully.

1. You can check the LabVM deployment status by navigating to the **LabRG** resource group, selecting **Deployments** in the resource group left-nav, and checking the status of the 'Microsoft.Template' deployment. Ensure the template deployment status is **Succeeded** before proceeding to the hands-on lab guide.

2. You can check the Contoso application deployment status by navigating to the **ContosoRG1** resource group, selecting **Deployments** in the resource group left-nav, and checking the status of the deployments. Make sure the deployment status is **Succeeded** for all templates before proceeding to the hands-on lab guide.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status 'Succeeded' for each template.](images/BeforeTheHOL/contoso-success1.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status Succeeded for each template")

3. Once the Contoso application deployment is successful, validate the application by opening the **WebVM1** virtual machine, copying the public IP address, and navigating to the public IP address in your browser.

    ![Go to WebVM1 in the resource group, locate the public IP address, and copy it into your web browser.](images/BeforeTheHOL/contoso-webvmpubip.png "Copy WebVM1 public IP address")

    ![The Contoso application window displays, showing a button for 'Current Policy Offerings.](images/BeforeTheHOL/contoso-app.png "Contoso application")

4. Select the **Current Policy Offerings** button to review the policy list. This verifies that the web tier can connect to the database.

## Summary

In these lab preparation steps, you set up a lab virtual machine, which includes Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, Azure PowerShell, and other files used during this lab. You also deployed and verified the Contoso sample application, which you will use in this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the hands-on lab.
