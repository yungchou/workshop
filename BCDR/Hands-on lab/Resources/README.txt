This folder contains scripts, templates and other files used for the lab.

All files should be copied to the cloudworkshop storage account at https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/building-resilient-iaas-architecture/lab-resources/<VERSION>/

Use a different <VERSION> at each lab revision.

All links in the templates, scripts, student files, and also in the lab guides themselves will need to be updated when changing <VERSION>

Do not link directly to files in Github. 

This approach makes it possible to work on lab updates in a separate branch without breaking existing labs.
