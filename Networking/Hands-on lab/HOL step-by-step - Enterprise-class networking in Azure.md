# Enterprise-class networking in Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will setup and configure virtual networks in a secure hub-and-spoke design. You will also learn how to secure virtual networks by implementing Azure Firewall, network security groups and application security groups, as well as configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network via a jump box and provision a site-to-site VPN connection from another virtual network, providing emulation of hybrid connectivity from an on-premises environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components.

## Overview

You have been asked by Woodgrove Financial Services to provision a proof of concept deployment that will be used by the Woodgrove team to gain familiarity with a complex Virtual Networking deployment, including all of the components that enable the solution. Specifically, the Woodgrove team will be learning:

- How to bypass system routing to accomplish custom routing scenarios.

- How to capitalize on load balancers to distribute load and ensure service availability.

- How to implement Azure Firewall to control hybrid and cross-virtual network traffic flow based on policies.

- How to implement a combination of Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) to control traffic flow within virtual networks.

- How to monitor network traffic for proper route configuration and trouble shooting.

The result of this proof of concept will be an environment resembling this diagram:
