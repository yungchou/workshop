# Enterprise-class networking in Azure

Woodgrove Financial Services has been in business for over 75 years and is a well-known and respected name brand in the financial industry. They are historically risk-adverse, and it has served them well, enabling them to weather several financial storms that closed the doors on similarly sized institutions. While Woodgrove started in the United States, around 20 years ago, they branched out into the international arena by acquiring a bank headquartered in Mexico City. Today, they have 224 branches in the United States and 64 in Mexico.

Woodgrove is committed to migrating to Microsoft Azure with the goal of modernizing their infrastructure and want to start with designing an enterprise-class network.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn to setup and configure a virtual network with subnets in Azure. You will learn how to secure the virtual network by deploying a network virtual appliance and configure firewall rules and route tables. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network with a jump box and a site-to-site VPN connection.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to plan and design virtual networks in Azure with multiple subnets to filter and control network traffic. In addition, you will learn to create a virtual network and provision subnets, create route tables with required routes, build a management jump box, configure firewalls to control traffic flow, and configure site-to-site connectivity.

### Whiteboard design session

In this Whiteboard design session, you will look at the process of configuring an enterprise-class network within Azure. Your design will include technologies to connect multiple virtual networks, as well as using capabilities such as routing to deploy network virtual appliances such as firewalls to secure your deployment.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design solutions using Azure Networking features and capabilities.

### Hands-on lab

In this Hands-on lab, you will setup and configure virtual networks in a secure hub-and-spoke design. You will also learn how to secure virtual networks by implementing Azure Firewall, network security groups and application security groups, as well as configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network via a jump box and provision a site-to-site VPN connection from another virtual network, providing emulation of hybrid connectivity from an on-premises environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components.
