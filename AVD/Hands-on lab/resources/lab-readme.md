# Lab Notes

The templates used in this Microsoft Cloud Workshop originated in the [ARM Templates used during Microsoft's WorkshopPLUS - M365:Windows Virtual Desktop](https://github.com/PeterR-msft/M365WVDWS) repository.

We have brought them here in the MCW so that we have the lab setup maintained with the MCW itself. That way, we can update the ARM templates to meet our needs.
