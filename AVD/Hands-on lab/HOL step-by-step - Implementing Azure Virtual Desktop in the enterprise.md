# Implementing Azure Virtual Desktop for the enterprise hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) infrastructure and learn how to set up a working AVD environment end-to-end in a typical Enterprise model. At the end of the lab, attendees will have deployed an Azure Active Directory Tenant with Azure AD Connect to an Active Directory Domain Controller running in Azure. You will also deploy the Azure infrastructure for the Azure Virtual Desktop Tenant(s), Host Pool(s), and session host(s). Then you will connect to an AVD session utilizing different supported devices and browsers. You will publish desktops and remote apps. Finally, you will configure user profiles and FSLogics with Azure file shares. Finally, you will configure monitoring and security for the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure and understand the steps to manage the gold images.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) solution. Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Azure Virtual Desktop allows you to choose a flexible end-user virtualized application or desktop delivery model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud strategy. AVD simplifies the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern and legacy desktop app experiences with unified management without needing to host, install, configure, and manage components such as diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway. AVD brings together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the only multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced IT costs while empowering today's modern digital workspace.

## Solution architecture

![This is the Solution architecture diagram described in the text below.](images/avdsolutiondiagramv2.png "Solution architecture")

This diagram shows an Azure Virtual Desktop architecture with on-premises servers for Active Directory. In the diagram, the host pools provide the AVD session to the different supported devices. Azure Monitor, Network Watcher, and Log Analytics monitor and log activity and performance metrics.

## Requirements

Before you start setting up your Azure Virtual Desktop workspace, make sure you have the following items:

- The Azure Active Directory tenant ID for Azure Virtual Desktop users.

- A global administrator account within the Azure Active Directory tenant.

  - This also applies to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) organizations creating an Azure Virtual Desktop workspace for their customers. When you are in a CSP organization, you must be able to sign in as a global administrator of the customer\'s Azure Active Directory tenant.

  - The administrator account must be sourced from the Azure Active Directory tenant in which you are trying to create the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace. This process does not support Azure Active Directory B2B (guest) accounts.

  - The administrator account must be a work or school account.

- An Azure subscription.

  - Enough Quota Cores to build four 4-core servers.

  - Access to the Azure Active Directory Global Admin account for your new or existing Azure Active Directory Tenant.

  - Owner rights on all Azure subscription(s).

## Before the hands-on lab

- Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide before continuing to the lab exercises.
  
- Make sure to track your user accounts and where you are using them.

- Regions and locations, make sure to stay consistent as much as possible.

## Troubleshooting

When you run into issues with your Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment, there will periodically be troubleshooting tips at the end of the current exercise. However, if the issues are not directly addressed, please feel free to reach out to your instructor or teacher.

Review the article [Troubleshooting overview, feedback, and support for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/troubleshoot-set-up-overview). Part of the article will cover steps used in [Exercise 8](#exercise-8-setup-monitoring-for-avd) and can help diagnose issues you may encounter.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Azure Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the AVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access, and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied to enhance security.

  |              |            | 

### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the list.

3. On the Resource groups blade, select the resource group name you created in the **Before the HOL** template deployment.

4. On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and select it. Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

    ![This image shows how to find the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/publicip.png "Public IP address for Domain Controller VM")

5. On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field. Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6. On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC**, and enter.

    ![This image shows the Run dialog window to run MSTSC.](images/run.png "Run on Windows")

7. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste the public IP address from the previous step. Select **Connect**.

    ![This image shows how the Window for Remote Desktop Connection will open to enter the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection")

8. When prompted, sign in with the AD domain UPN credentials. For example, when you used the ARM template from [Before HOL setup guide](), the credentials will be something along the lines of: [adadmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:adadmin@MyADDomain.com) with the password you entered when deploying the ARM template in the before the hands-on lab. If prompted, select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning. If the dialog appears asking to make the server discoverable on the network, select No.

    >**Note**: This is the Active Directory account from the ARM template, not the Azure AD Global Admin account. When you have trouble signing in, try typing the credentials in manually, as copy and paste may include an unnecessary space, which will cause authentication to fail.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security and installing Edge

To simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1. Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2. In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left., then locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and select **On**.

    ![This image shows the Local Server properties in server manager, locate Enhanced Security configuration.](images/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

3. On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how you select the current configuration, a new window will open that will allow you to disable the enhanced security configuration.](images/disablesecurity.png "Disable enhanced security configuration")

4. Open Internet Explorer, and navigate to [Download Microsoft Edge for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download). Select to download the **Windows 64-bit** version.

    ![The screenshot shows the Windows 64-bit download link on the website.](images/downloadedge.png "Download Windows 64-bit edge")

5. Select to Agree and Download, then select to Run the .msi. Internet Explorer has been officially retired, so you will use Edge as the default browser for this lab.

### Task 3: Creating a domain admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice.

1. In Server Manager, select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to find Tools in the upper right corner to access the Server Manager Tools.](images/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2. In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![In this image, you find the folder path for users and right-click to add a new user.](images/newUser.png "Folder path for new user")

3. Complete the New User wizard.

    ![The window that will open with the fields to complete for a new user.](images/newuserobject.png "Create a new user")

    ![The next window that will allow you to assign a password.](images/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window")

    ![This image shows the final screen of the wizard that will allow you to review and finish the new user setup.](images/finishnewuser.png "Finish new user setup")

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at the next logon**.

4. In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on the new user account object and select **Add to a group**.

    ![This image shows when the new user is created, we will find that username and right-click to add the user to a group.](images/addusertogroup.png "Add new user to a group")

5. On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and select **OK**.

    >**Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 

    ![This image shows how we will add this user to the Domain Admins group.](images/addusertodomainadmins.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1. On the domain controller, run the following PowerShell script to ensure TLS 1.2 is enabled. If it isn't enabled, the configuration of Azure AD Connect will fail.

    ```powershell
    New-Item 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null

    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null

    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null

    New-Item 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null

    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null

    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319' -name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null

    New-Item 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server' -Force | Out-Null
    
    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server' -name 'Enabled' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null
    
    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server' -name 'DisabledByDefault' -value 0 -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null
    
    New-Item 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client' -Force | Out-Null
    
    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client' -name 'Enabled' -value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null
    
    New-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client' -name 'DisabledByDefault' -value 0 -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Host 'TLS 1.2 has been enabled.'
    ```

2. Locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and open it.

    ![This image shows the Azure AD Connect icon on the Domain controller VM desktop.](images/azureadconnect.png "Azure AD Connect desktop icon")

    >**Note**: The installation of Azure AD Connect may fail if the server has not been updated to enable TLS 1.2. If this is the case, run the following PowerShell script to enable and then re-open Azure AD Connect.

3. Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen, select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![The install wizard will take you to the Azure AD Connect setup screen.](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD Connect setup screen")

4. On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. For example: [azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and the correct password. Select **Next**.

    ![After selecting "Use express settings", the next window will require you to enter your Azure Active Directory username and password.](images/adconnectazuresub.png "Azure AD Connect - Azure AD login")
    >**Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

5. On the Connect to AD DS page, enter the Active Directory credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, when you used the ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials will be something along the lines of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with the password: **AVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Select **Next**.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will enter the AD DS domain and admin username and password.](images/azureadconnectdclogin.png "Azure AD Connect - Domain login")

    >**Note**: When you copy and paste the password, make sure there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

6. Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will select the box to continue without matching all UPN suffixes and select next to continue.](images/azureadsigninconfig.png "Azure AD sign-in configuration")

    ![This image shows the final setup window, select the box to start the synchronization process and select install.](images/azureadready.png "Azure AD Connect Ready to configure")

7. After a few minutes, the Azure AD Connect installation will be complete. Select **Exit**.

    ![The installation is complete, and the Configuration complete window will be present.](images/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")

8. Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

9. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

10. Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it from the list.

11. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

12. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized.  

    ![This image shows the list of users you should see in Azure Active Directory synchronized from Active Directory with Azure AD Connect.](images/adconnectsync.png "Synchronized users list")

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.

## Exercise 2: Create Azure AD groups for AVD

Duration:  30 minutes

In this exercise, you will work with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups to assist in managing access assignments to your application groups in AVD. The new ARM portal for AVD supports access assignments using Azure AD groups. This capability simplifies access management. Groups will also be leveraged in this guide to manage
permissions in Azure Files for FSLogix.

You will create three Azure AD groups to manage access to the different application groups: Personal, Pooled, and RemoteApp. For this guide, we will only create a single group for RemoteApps, but in a production scenario, it is more common to use separate groups based on the app or persona defined by the customer. Make a note of the groups you create; they will be used in later exercises.

It is also important to keep in mind that these groups can also originate from the Windows Active Directory environment and synchronize via Azure AD Connect. This will be another common scenario for customers that already have processes defined on-premises for group management.

### Task 1: Creating Azure AD groups

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3. On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left and select **+ New group**.

    ![An image highlighting the New group button in Azure AD Groups.](images/newgroupbutton.png "New Azure AD Group button")

4. On the New Group page, fill in the following options, and select **Create**.

    - **Group type:** Security

    - **Group name:** AVD Pooled Desktop User

    - **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Pooled Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup2.png "New Group Window")

5. Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and select **Create**.

    - **Group type:** Security

    - **Group name:** AVD Remote App All Users

    - **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Remote App All users for the group name.](images/newGroup1.png "New Group Window")

6. Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and select **Create**.

    - **Group type:** Security

    - **Group name:** AVD Persistent Desktop User

    - **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![This image shows how to create a new security group type and provide the AVD Persistent Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup3.png "New Group Window")

7. Confirm that the groups have been added by going to **Azure Active Directory** and selecting **Groups**. Then, scroll down to the bottom of the list of groups; the three groups you created should be listed.

    ![This image shows how to go to Azure Active Directory Groups to view the list of groups.](images/aadgroups.png "Azure Active Directory Groups")

    ![This image shows where to scroll to the bottom of the list to view the three new groups that were created.](images/aadnewgroups.png "Azure Active Directory Groups")

### Task 2: Assign users to groups

Now that the Azure AD groups are in place, you will assign users for testing. Once the groups are populated, you can leverage them to assign access to AVD resources once they are created.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3. On the **Azure Active Directory** page, select **Groups** on the left and select the **AVD Persistent Desktop User** group.

4. Select **Members** and **+ Add Members**

    ![This image shows how to add members to the persistent desktop user group from within the Azure AD blade.](images/newMember.png "Azure AD blade")

5. In the search field, enter the name of one of the users shown below and select them. Repeat this for each user; use the **Select** button to add them to the group.

    ![The list of users that you should be adding to each of the groups.](images/aadavdusers.png "Azure AD groups")

6. Repeat steps 4-6 for the **AVD Pooled Desktop User** and **AVD Remote App All Users** groups.

    At this point, you have three new Azure AD groups with members assigned. Make a note of the group names and accounts you added for use later in this guide. These groups will be used to assign access to AVD application groups.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you will create an Azure File share and enable SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for AVD users. At the end of this exercise, you will have the following components:

- A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

- A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

- AD authentication is enabled for your Azure storage account.

- Permissions applied for user access to the file share.

### Task 1: Create a storage account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same Azure AD tenant in which you're a global admin. The users and groups you just created will need to be added with access to this storage account.

2. At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access the search menu bar and search for storage accounts.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

3. On the Storage Accounts window that appears, select **+ Add**.

    ![This screenshot depicts the + Create button for a new storage account.](images/createstorage.png "The +Create button for a new storage account")

4. Fill in the required parameters for the storage account. Refer to the following example for more information on the available parameters. Make a note that contains the values you provide for **Resource group** and **Storage account name**. These will be needed later in the exercise.

    ![This image shows how to enter the information to create a new storage account.](images/createstorageaccount.png "Create a storage account")

    >**Note**: The storage account name should be 15 characters or less in length.

5. Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.

6. Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share

1. At the top of the Azure Portal page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2. On the Storage accounts blade, select the storage account you created in Task 1.

3. On the Overview page for your Storage account, select **File shares**.

    ![This image shows that once the storage account is created, from the overview blade, to select File shares.](images/storagefileshare.png "Create a File share")

4. On the File shares blade, select **+ File Share**.

    ![You must select the add icon in File shares to create a new file share.](images/addfileshare.png "Add file share")

5. Enter a Name for the new file share, select **Hot** Tier, and select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to give the file share a name and a storage quota in gigabits.](images/newfileshare.png "New File share")

    >**Note**: The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD authentication for your storage account

**Prerequisites**

1. The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain-joined computer. The **AzFilesHybrid** module uses the AD PowerShell module, so running from a server is preferred.

2. The account used in this task needs to meet the following requirements:

    - Synchronized with Azure AD.

    - Permissions to create a user or computer objects in Active Directory.

    - Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task, you will complete the steps on the Domain Controller in Azure using an account assigned Global Administrator and Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this back if you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1. From a domain joined computer, download and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases).

    **Link address**: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases

    ![This image shows the view of the GitHub site for Azure samples.](images/azfileshybriddownload.png "Azure samples")

2. From the GitHub repository, select and open the AzFilesHybrid.zip file to the domain-joined computer **Documents** folder.

    ![This image shows that when prompted to save the file, select "save as" to choose the location.](images/filesaveas.png)

3. Extract this file to the **Documents** folder on the local Domain controller.

    ![This image shows how to open the zip file and select extract all.](images/extractzipfile.png "Extract zip file to documents")

    ![This image shows how to choose the location to extract the files within the zip file to the documents folder.](images/extractlocation.png "Extract to documents")

4. Open an elevated PowerShell console by finding **PowerShell** in the start menu. Right-click on the icon and select **Run as administrator**.

    ![This image shows how to locate the PowerShell icon on the domain computer desktop, right-click and select run as administrator.](images/runasadministrator.png)

5. Configure the PowerShell execution policy **Unrestricted** for the current user. When prompted for confirmation, type **Y** and push return.

    ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

6. Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid. For example:

    ```cmd
    cd C:\Users\ADAdmin\Documents\AzFilesHybrid\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![This image shows how the path to the file should be the documents folder location in file explorer.](images/filelocation.png "Documents folder path")

7. Install the Az PowerShell module. If any confirmation prompts appear, type **Y** and push return.

    ```powershell  
    Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

8. Install the AzFilesHybrid module. If you are prompted with a security warning, type **r** and then press enter to proceed with running it.

    ```powershell
    .\CopyToPSPath.ps1
    ```

9. Import the AzFilesHybrid module. If you are prompted with a security warning, type **r** and then press enter to proceed with running it. You may also be prompted to update PowerShellGet, type **y**, and press return. After that, you'll need to restart your PowerShell session. After restarting the PowerShell session, run the command below again.

    ```powershell
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![After running these commands, the results will look like this screenshot.](images/azimportresults.png "Command results")

10. Sign in with an account that meets the prerequisites. (A global admin in the Azure AZ tenant that houses your AVD users and the file share you created.)

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

11. Create the following PowerShell variables replacing the subscription id, resource group name, and storage account with the information specific to your lab environment:

    ```powershell
    $SubscriptionId = "<subscription-id>"
    $ResourceGroupName = "<resource-group-name>"
    $StorageAccountName = "<storage-account-name>"
    ```

    ![This image illustrates setting the three variables.](images/setvariables.png "Setting variables in PowerShell")

    >**Note**: The Resource Group Name and Storage Account Name were assigned in Task 1.

    >**Note**: You can run **Get-AzSubscription** to look up the available subscription names.

    ![This image shows where you would find the subscription Id when running the Get-AzSubscription command.](images/subscriptionid.png "Subscription Id")

12. Select the target subscription for the current session.
  
    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
    ```

13. Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain.

    ```powershell
    Join-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName
   
    ```

14. When the script completes, you will be provided confirmation that you are connected to the storage account.

    ![This image shows the confirmation of the storage account connection.](images/storageconfirmed.png "Storage account confirmation")

15. Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory Users and Computers** by going to Domain controllers and looking for the computer object for the Azure storage account.

    ![This image is what the newly created computer object looks like in Active Directory.](images/confirmnewobject.png "Active Directory object")

16. Confirm that the feature is enabled.

    ```powershell
    $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
    ```

17. List the directory service of the selected service account.

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
    ```

18. List the directory domain information if the storage account has enabled AD authentication for file shares.

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
    ```

    ![This image is what the responses should be when running the previous PowerShell tasks.](images/confirmpowershell.png "PowerShell task responses")

19. Confirm activation with your domain by navigating to the Azure portal, going to the storage account, and selecting **Files shares** under **Data storage**. Refer to the File share settings to see **Configured** on Active Directory (AD), as shown in the example below.

    >**Note**: You may need to navigate out of the storage account and back in for the File share settings to change.

    ![This image shows how Active Directory Domain Services is configured in the storage account configuration.](images/portalconfirm.png "Storage account configuration")

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure share permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level permissions to users and/or groups:

- **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader**: allows read access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

- **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor**: allows read, write, and delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

- **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor**: allows read, write, delete, and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access a particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create four new security groups in Active Directory to manage share permissions.

1. From a domain joined computer, open **Server Manager**, then navigate to **Tools** to open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to navigate to Tools to access Active Directory Users and Computers to create a new group.](images/aduserscomputers.png "Active Directory Users and Computers under Tools")

2. Under the local domain, select **Builtin** and select **Create a new group in the current container**.

    ![This image shows how to open the window on the domain controller VM server manager and go to the Active Directory users and computers, select the Builtin folder, and select to create a new security group.](images/adgroups.png "Create new groups")

3. Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that is synchronized with Azure AD:

    - **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Contributor.](images/azfcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Contributor")

    - **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor.](images/azfelevcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

    - **AZF FSLogix Reader**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Reader.](images/azfreader.png "AZF FSLogix Reader")

    - **AVD Users**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AVD User.](images/avduser.png "AVD User")

    - **AVD App Hosts**

        ![The new group dialog showing the Group name set to AVD App Hosts, a Global Security Group and selecting OK.](images/avdapphosts.png)

4. Add the AVD administrative account that you created previously to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file share permissions.

    ![This image shows how to find the AVD admin user that you created previously and right-click to add to a group.](images/chooseadmin.png)

5. Type **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **Ok** to save.

    ![This image shows how to add the AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor group to this user.](images/addadmin.png)

6. Add the group **AVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix Contributor** by going to the Builtin groups, locating AVDUsers, and right-click to **Add to a group**.
  
    ![This shows how you would find the AVD Users group and add it to a group.](images/avduseraddtogroup.png)

    ![This image shows where you enter the FSLogix contributor group and check the name before adding.](images/avduseraddgroup.png)

7. Add user accounts to the group **AVD Users** by selecting **OrgUsers** and choosing all the users in the list. Next, select all the users and right-click to add them to a group. These users will have access to use FSLogix profiles. Also, add the **AVD Admin** user to these groups.

    ![This image shows the list of users in the organization, select the users and add them to the AVD Users group.](images/avdaddusers.png "Add users to the AVD users group")

8. Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD. These groups can be verified by going to **Groups** within **Azure Active Directory** and looking for the names in the list.

    ![This image shows where you would verify that the groups that were created on the domain controller have synchronized with Azure AD.](images/newgroups.png)

    With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This will enable you to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

9. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to search for storage accounts from the Azure portal on the search bar.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

10. On the Storage accounts blade, select the Storage account you created in Task 1.

11. On the blade for your storage account, locate and select **File shares**. Then, on the File shares blade, select your file share.

    ![This image shows how to, from the Storage account, locate File shares under Data storage in the menu and select your file share to adjust the settings.](images/avdselectfileshare.png "Navigate to file share settings")

12. Select **Access Control (IAM)**, and then select **+ Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

    ![This image shows that, under access control, you will locate and select add under add a role assignment in the storage account.](images/addroleassign.png "Add Azure AD Role assignment")

13. On the Add role assignment page, search for and select Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor and select **Next**.

    ![This screenshot shows Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor permission level selected and the Next button highlighted.](images/addsmbsharecontributor.png "Add Storage File DAta SMB Share Contributor permissions")

14. Select **+Select members** and add the **AZF FSLogix Contributor** and **AVD App Hosts** group. Select the **Select** button and then select **Review + assign** and **Review + assign** again.

    ![The members tab for adding a role assignment is shown in the screenshot with the steps to select members, select the AZF FSLogix Contributor Security Group, and assign it permissions.](images/addsmbpermissions.png "Add Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor permission to AZF FSLogix Contributor")

15. Repeat steps 12 - 14 for the remaining two roles.

    - Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor \> AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor

    ![This image shows adding the storage file data SMB share elevated contributor role to the AZF FSLogix elevated contributor role that was created within Active Directory.](images/addazvelevatedcontributor.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

    - Storage File Data SMB Share Reader \> AZF FSLogix Reader

    ![This image shows adding the storage file data SMB share reader role to the AZF FSLogix Reader role that was created within Active Directory.](images/addazfreader.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

### Task 5: Configure NTFS permissions for the file share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper determining whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows iCACLS or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your storage account key.

>**Note**: To complete this task, you will need to disable secure transfer in the storage account. This can be accessed from the storage account **Configuration** and selecting **Disabled** under **Secure transfer required**. Select **Save** to save the changes.

![This image shows how, within the configuration, you will disable secure transfer required and save.](images/disablesecuretransfer.png "Disable secure transfer")

1. Reboot the domain controller you created before starting the lab. In some cases, this is needed to be able to grant NTFS permissions.

2. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

3. On the Storage accounts blade, select File share in the storage account you created in Task 1.

4. On the blade for the file share within your storage account, select **Connect**. This will open the **Connect** blade. 

    ![This image shows how to use the storage account properties blade to open the Connect blade.](images/connectstorage.png "Connect to storage")

    >**Note**: The base URL is also available under the **Properties** of the storage account under the **File service** entry.  

5. On the **Connect** blade, select Drive letter **Z**, **Storage account key** for the Authentication method. 

    ![This is an image of the drive letter and authentication method settings for connecting the storage account.](images/storagesettings.png "Storage connect settings")

6. On the **Connect** blade for your storage account, copy the **PowerShell** script located in the gray text box.

    ![Here is the script's location to copy to run in Windows PowerShell.](images/copyscript.png "Connect script")

7. From a domain joined computer, open **PowerShell**, and paste the **PowerShell** script that you copied from the **Connect** blade. 

    ![This image shows the pasting of the PowerShell script and the status of the connection.](images/powershellconnect.png "PowerShell file share connection")

    >**Note**: After running the script, if you receive a CMDKEY: Credential added successfully and drive name **Z** appears, the script has run correctly. If this fails, it may be that this is an SMB connection on port 445, and many consumer ISPs block this port by default. When doing this in your lab and experiencing issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a domain-joined VM in Azure. 

    ![This image shows the "successfully completed" prompt after the net use command is completed successfully. You will also be able to see the drive as a network location in file explorer.](images/successfulstoragemap.png "Connected network drive")

8. Open **File Explorer**, right-click on the **Z:** drive, and select **Properties**.

9. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

    ![This image shows how to, in the properties for the drive, select the security folder and select advanced.](images/drivesecurity.png "Network drive security settings")

10. Select **Add** and add each of the AD security groups below with the appropriate permissions, you can only add one at a time. Select check names as each are entered to verify the connection.

    | AD Group | NTFS Permissions | Applies to |
    |----------|------------------|------------|
    | **AZF FSLogix Contributor** | Modify | This folder, subfolders, and files|
    | **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** | Full control |This folder, subfolders, and files|
    | **AZF FSLogix Reader** | Read & execute |This folder, subfolders, and files|
    | **AVD Users** | Modify (This folder only) |This folder only|
    | **AVD App Hosts** | Modify | This folder, subfolders, and files |

    ![Choose by selecting a principal to open the select user, computer, service account, or group window. In the "enter the object name" window, enter the FSLogix groups that were created previously. Check names and select ok.](images/addobjects.png "Steps to add principal object permissions")

11. Repeat step 10 once for each AD Group, until all five are added.

12. Select **OK** to save your changes. Select **Yes** if you receive a **Windows Security** warning about removing inherited permissions.

    ![This image shows that after adding all four objects as principals, they will be in the list of permission entries.](images/addsecuritycomplete.png "New security permissions added")

### Task 6: Configure NTFS permissions for the containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions. There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions for use with Profile Containers and Office Containers. Below is one configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn't require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task, we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile types and assign the recommended permissions.

1. Navigate to the networked drive in File explorer.

    ![This is an image of where you will find the network drive you mounted in the previous task.](images/networkdrive.png "Network drive location")

2. Create two new folder directories in the root share.

    - **Profiles**
    - **MSIX**

    ![This image shows that after adding two folders, File Explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](images/newfolders.png "New folders in drive z")

3. Right-click on the **Profiles** directory and select **Properties**.

4. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

5. Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![This image is the screen where you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png "Remove inherited permissions")

6. Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** and check **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png "Set full control for FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

7. Select **Add** and add **Creator owner**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how the add the creator owner object.](images/addcreatorowner.png "Add Creator owner principal")

    ![This image shows how to set the permissions for full control to the creator owner.](images/addfullcontrolcreator.png "Grant full control to creator owner")

8. Select **Add** and add **AVD Users**. Grant the following four special permissions and select to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    - Traverse folder / execute file

    - List folder / read data

    - Read attributes

    - Create folders / append data

    ![This image shows the special permissions for AVD users.](images/userfolderpermissions.png "AVD users folder permissions")

9. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

    ![This image shows the list of permission objects just created.](images/permissionscomplete.png "Permissions for Profiles folder")

10. Right-click on the **MSIX** directory and select **Properties**.

11. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

12. Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![This image is the screen where you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png "Remove inherited permissions")

13. Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png "Add FSLogix Elevated Contributor full control")

14. Select **Add** and add **AVD Users**. Grant **Read & execute** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This image shows the custom permissions for the AVD users on the MSIX folder.](images/msixavdusers.png "Add AVD users permissions")

15. Repeat the step above for **AVD App Hosts**.

16. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

    ![This image shows the list of permission objects just created for the MSIX folder.](images/msixpermissions.png "Permissions for MSIX folder")

16. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

Your Azure Files Share is now ready for FSLogix profile containers.

## Exercise 4: Create a gold image for AVD

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you will walk through the process of creating a gold image for your AVD host pools. The basic concept for a gold image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on mandatory updates, applications, and configurations. There are many ways to create and manage images for AVD. The steps covered in this exercise will walk you through a basic build and capture process that includes core applications and recommended configuration options for AVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the same account you used to set up the storage account.

2. On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.

3. On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**. Select one of the **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session** builds and **Create**.

    >**Note:** The higher the version, the better to minimize the number of Windows updates you need to install later.

    ![This image shows the window will display the creation of a New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909.](images/windows10VM.png "New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909")

    >**Note**: In this exercise, we are selecting a base Windows 10 image to start with and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version based on your requirements.

4. On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields shown below. 

    ![What your configuration should be for the virtual machine image.](images/win10vmcreate.png "Create virtual machine")

    >**Note**: Make a note of the **username** and **password** used to create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after creation.
    >
    >**Note**: This guide does not walk through the process of creating a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to allow **RDP (3389)**, or have a bastion host deployed for remote access.

    ![In the "Create a virtual machine" page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM, allow port 3389 as an inbound port.](images/windows10VMcreate.png "The 'Create a virtual machine' page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM")

5. Select the checkbox to confirm eligible Windows 10 licensing and create the VM by selecting **Review + create** and then **Create**.

    ![This image shows the Windows 10 licensing confirmation and the selection to Review and create.](images/windows10licensing.png "Confirm Windows 10 licensing")

6. Once the VM is successfully deployed, go to the resource and connect using RDP. Sign in using the credentials you supplied when creating the VM.

    ![This image shows the select connect in the Windows 10 VM overview to RDP to the VM.](images/connectwin10vm.png "Connect to Windows 10 VM")

7. Download the RDP file and open the RDP file to connect.

    ![This image shows the download RDP button and the file that is downloaded to connect to the VM.](images/connectrdp.png "Download and run RDP file")

### Task 2: Run Windows Update

Despite the Azure support team's best efforts, the Marketplace images are not always up to date. Therefore, the best and most secure practice is keeping your gold image updated.

1. From your gold image VM, open the **Settings** app and select **Updates & Security**.

    ![This image shows that, on the new Windows 10 VM image, go to the settings window and select update and security.](images/w10VMSettings.png "The settings window within the Windows 10 VM")

2. Install all missing updates, rebooting as necessary.

    >**Note**: After initial updates found during startup have been installed and you have rebooted the VM, check for updates again before proceeding. There may be additional updates that need to be installed.

3. Once the VM is fully patched, the Windows Update Settings page should resemble the following screenshot.

    ![After checking for and running any updates, the settings window shows that Windows update is up to date.](images/w10vmSettingsUpToDate.png "The settings window showing that Windows update is up to date")

### Task 3: Prepare an AVD image

**Introduction to the script**

The authors for this content have developed a scripted solution to assist in automating some common baseline image build tasks.

## Exercise 5: Create a host pool for personal desktops

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise, we will create an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool for personal desktops. This is a set of computers or hosts which operate on an as-needed basis. In a pooled configuration, we will host multiple non-persistent sessions with no user profile information stored locally. This is where FSLogix Profile Containers dynamically provide the users' profile to the host. This allows an organization to fully utilize the compute resources on a single host and lower the total overhead, cost, and the number of remote workstations.

6. On the **Enter your credentials** prompt, sign in using the same account from Step 3 and select **Submit**.

    >**Note**: The username and password to login to the AVD desktop will be credentials from the domain controller username and password created upon initial deployment. When you need the user email, RDP into the domain controller VM and find the user in the **Active Directory Users and Groups** and **OrgUsers**.

    ![This image shows that on the domain controller VM, you can find the username here.](images/dcusername.png "Domain username")

    ![This image shows where to enter the username from the domain controller and the password created during the initial lab deployment.](images/dccreds.png "Enter username and password")

7. Once connected, validate the components relative to your configuration. You can find the Office applications when you go to the Windows start menu.

    ![This image shows what the desktop AVD image should look like.](images/avddesktopimage.png "AVD Desktop")

**Troubleshooting**

**Web client stops responding or disconnects**

Try connecting using another browser or client.

If issues continue even after you\'ve switched browsers, the problem may not be with your browser but your network. We recommend you contact network support.

**Web client keeps prompting for credentials**

If the Web client keeps prompting for credentials, follow these instructions:

1. Confirm the web client URL is correct.

2. Confirm that the credentials you\'re using are for the Azure Virtual Desktop environment tied to the URL.

3. Clear browser cookies.

4. Clear browser cache.

5. Open your browser in Private mode.

## Exercise 8: Setup monitoring for AVD

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up monitoring for the AVD host pools. There are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role: troubleshooting, performance, security, etc. Multiple components make up the AVD service, which can add some variation to how customers implement monitoring (e.g., adding additional third-party solutions). By the end of this exercise, you will have the following monitoring capabilities enabled:

- Diagnostic logging for the AVD service

- Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

- Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each monitoring capability covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC controls, query performance, report development, etc. For AVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single dedicated workspace.

In this exercise, we will create a dedicated workspace for our environment. When you already have a workspace created, move on to Task 2.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**log analytics workspace**\"; select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to search for log analytics and select the service from the Azure Portal search bar.](images/searchloganalytics.png "Search for Log Analytics")

3. On the Log Analytics workspaces blade, select **+ Create**.

    ![Within the Log Analytics blade, you will select add to create a new workspace.](images/createlogworkspace.png "Add a Log Analytics workspace")

4. On the Create Log Analytics workspace blade, fill in the following information, and select **Review + Create**.

    - **Subscription:** Select the desired subscription for the Log Analytics workspace.

    - **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select one from the list.

    - **Name:** Enter a unique name for the workspace.

    - **Region:** Select a region for the workspace.

5. Select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to select a resource group and enter a unique name for the Log Analytics workspace.](images/configlogworkspace.png "Configure the Log Analytics workspace")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. Once complete, move on to task 2.

### Task 2: Enabling diagnostic logging for AVD

Like many other Azure services, AVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts. To enable diagnostic data collection, you need to enable it for each ARM object you want to monitor (e.g., Host pools, Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each AVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available. For example, host pool objects will have different options than Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data category and its associated objects.

  |              |            |     |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Category**  |**Description**  |                                                                 **ARM Object(s)** |
  Checkpoint   |       Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on. |  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces
  Connection    |      When users initiate and complete connections to the service.    |                                                                                                                                             Host pools
  Error       |        Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you if the information is joined with the activities.     |               Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces |
  Feed   |             Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?      |                                                                                     Workspaces |
  Host Registration  | Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?       |                                                                                 Host pools| 
  Management     |     Track whether attempts to change Azure Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?       |                  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces

At this point, you should have diagnostic data enabled on at least 1 AVD ARM object of each type. To enable monitoring for additional objects,  repeat the above steps for each object.

### Task 6: Enabling Azure Monitor for the session hosts

Azure Monitor is leveraged with AVD to monitor the performance and health of your session host VMs. This feature can be enabled for Azure VMs in several ways. This exercise will walk through enabling Azure Monitor on VMs using the Azure portal. Refer to the following links for guidance on automation.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**virtual machines**\". Select **Virtual Machines** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access Azure Virtual Desktop from the Azure portal search bar.](images/searchvm.png "Search for Virtual machines")

3. On the Virtual Machines blade, locate a session host VM and select the name.

4. On the blade for the virtual machine, under **Monitoring**, select **Insights**.

    ![This image shows that from the domain controller VM, you will select insights under monitoring in the menu.](images/vminsights.png "Virtual Machine Insights")

5. On the Insights blade, select **Enable**. This will initiate a validation check.

    ![This image shows the insights blade, where you will select enable to enable insights on the virtual machine.](images/enableinsights.png "Enable VM Insights")

    >**Note**: The virtual machine must be running to enable Azure Monitor.

6. On the Insights setup page, fill in the following information, and select **Enable**.

    - **Workspace Subscription:** Select the desired subscription.

    - **Choose a Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the workspace used in the previous task.

    ![This image shows the enable insights blade, where you will select the Log Analytics workspace and select enable.](images/vminsightsconfig.png "Log Analytics workspace configuration for VM Insights")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. This can take 5-10 minutes. Once complete, you will see the following items configured on the VM:

**New VM Extensions Added**. Two new extensions are added to the VM Extensions blade in Azure.

**New Monitoring Agents Installed**. Two new agents are installed on the VM.

**Monitoring Agent Configured for Log Analytics** The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is configured for your log analytics workspace.

![This image shows the new agents installed for monitoring the VM with log analytics.](images/vmonitoringextensions.png "Log Analytics extensions install on the VM")

At this point, you should have Azure Monitor enabled on at least one session host VM. To enable Azure Monitor for additional session hosts, repeat the above steps. For automation, leverage Azure Policy or PowerShell to enable monitoring on multiple VMs.

**Example Kusto Queries**

For a list of example queries, refer to the following Docs article:

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 

**Troubleshooting**

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. An example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Azure Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of AVD, there may be challenges with either having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.

## Exercise 9: Improving your AVD environment

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will improve the AVD experience by utilizing additional features or tools with the host pools. AVD is designed to be a versatile platform to distribute and build your solutions from. These optional features allow you to enhance and/or secure the environment depending on your needs. By the end of this exercise, you will have the following features enabled:

- Autoscale pooled pool based on connections

- Centralized Application Management (MSIX App Attach)

- Protect your environment via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

### Task 1: Configure permissions for Autoscale

In this task, we'll configure the permissions necessary to enable auto scall in Azure Virtual Desktop.

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal, and the subscription Azure Virtual Desktop is running in.

2. Select Access control (AIM). Select **+ Add** and **Add custom role**.

    ![Selecting to add a custom role in the Access Control for your Azure subscription.](images/addcustomrole.png "Adding a custom role to an Azure Subscription")

3. Enter a role name and description, then select **Next**.

    ![Enter the custom role andm and description for the new AVD Autoscale role in the subscription.](images/avdcustomrolebasics.png "Create a custom AVD Role Basics tab")

4. On the permissions tab, select **Next**; we aren't adding any permissions yet.

5. On the assignable scopes tab, select **Next**.

6. On the JSON tab, select **Edit**, then copy and paste the JSON below into the "actions": [] array.

    ```JSON
    "Microsoft.Insights/eventtypes/values/read",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/restart/action",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/powerOff/action",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/read",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/write",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/read",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/write",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/delete",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/read",
    "Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/sendMessage/action"
    ```

    ![The JSON from above correctly entered into the custom role definition settings with the Save button highlighted.](images/editjson.png)

7. Select **Save**, **Review + Create**, then **Review + assign**.

8. Now, we need to assign the role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal. Back on the **Access control (AIM)** settings for the subscription, select **+ Add** and **Add role assignment**.

    ![Adding a role assignment for the newly created custom role within the Access control for the Azure subscription.](images/addroleassignment.png "Add role assignment in Azure subscription")

9. Select the **AVD Autoscale** custom role we just created and select **Next**.

    ![Selecting the new AVD Autoscale role so it can be assigend to a user.](images/assigncustomrole.png "Select the new custom role")

10. Select **+ Select members**, search for and select **Azure Virtual Desktop**.

    ![Selecting the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal so it will be assigend the AVD Autoscale role.](images/selectazurevirtualdesktop.png "Select the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal")

11. Select **Review + assign**, then **Create**

### Task 2: Enabling Autoscale

In this task, you will enable the scaling of your pool based on the number of connections. Azure Virtual Desktop allows you to create scaling plans which will enable us to automatically increase and decrease the number of hosts in an AVD host pool based on the demand of the environment.

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and go to Azure Virtual Desktop.

2. Select **Scaling plans** under **Manage**, then select **Create scaling plan**.

    ![The Scaling plans in Azure virtual desktop with the button highlighted to Create a scaling plan.](images/createscalingplan.png "Create a new AVD scaling plans")

3. Select the resource group and location for Azure Virtual Desktop. Then give your scaling plan a friendly name and select **Next: Schedules >**.

    ![The basic settings for the scaling plan are highlighted.](images/scalingplanbasics.png "AVD Scaling Plan Basics")

4. Select **+ Add schedule**. Keep the defaults in General and select **Next**.

    ![This image shows the general settings for a new schedule.](images/scalingschedulegeneral.png "General settings for a new scaling schedule")

5. Within Ramp-up, review the settings, but we'll take the default settings again. Start time entails two things, the start of when you start to power on VMs and the end time of off-peak hours. Minimum is the minimum percentage of VMs that should be powered on starting at this time. The capacity threshold is what percentage of capacity needs to be used before another virtual machine is powered on. For example, with a pool of 10 VMs and a capacity of 20 sessions, at 8:00 am, a minimum of two VMs would be on. Once you get to 12 active sessions, a 3rd virtual machine will be powered on. Select **Next**.

    ![The Ramp-Up settings when adding a schedule for autoscale. Showing the default settings for Start Time, Load blanacing algorithm, Minimum percentage of hosts, and capacity threshold.](images/scalingschedulerampup.png "Schedule settings for ramp-up")

6. Peak hours is another one we won't make any changes to, but review the settings. The minimum number of VMs turned on will carry over from ramp-up as well as the capacity threshold.

    ![The Peak hours settings when adding a schedule for autoscale. Showing the Start time, Load balancing algorithm and capacity threshold.](images/scalingschedulepeakhours.png "Schedule settings for peak hours")

7. Ramp down is the time you want to start shutting down virtual machines and is the end of peak hours. Here the minimum percentage of hosts should be smaller than ramp-up and peak hours as you want to start shutting down virtual machines. The default is 10 percent, meaning in a pool of 10 virtual machines, you want to leave no less than 1 VM powered on. The capacity threshold will turn virtual machines on if you hit it, but this should be a larger number, so you aren't powering on virtual machines as you try to ramp down. The final set of settings is around logging users out. To shut down virtual machines, users need to log off and shift their sessions to other hosts. These settings allow you to configure if the user logout is forced, how long after they log out the machine is shut down, and the message given to users. Leave all settings the default and select **Next**.

    ![The Ramp-down settings when adding a schedule for autoscale. Showing the default settings for Start time, Load balancing algorithm, minimum percentage of hosts, capacity threshold, force logoff users, delay time before logging out users and notification message.](images/scalingschedulerampdown.png "Schedule settings for ramp-down")

8. Off-peak hours is the time that ramp-down will end and will also take the capacity threshold from the ramp-down settings. This capacity threshold takes the higher value from ramp-down as you don't want machines powered on during off-peak hours unless necessary. The off-peak hours will end when the next ramp-up time starts. Select **Add**.

    ![The Off-peak hours settings when adding a schedule for autoscale. Showing the default settings for Start time and Load balancing algorithm.](images/scalingscheduleoffpeak.png "Schedule settings for off-peak hours.")

9. You'll see your new schedule added to the scaling plan schedule. Select **Next: Host pool assignments >**.

    ![The new schedule added to the AVD scaling plan.](images/scalingschedule.png "Schedule added to the scaling plan")

10. Select your load balanced host pool in the drop-down, ensure **Enable autoscale** is selected, select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

    ![Selecing the host pool to add the autoscale settings to and select the checkbox to enable autoscale.](images/scalingplancreate.png "Create the scaling plan")

At this point, your AVD Host Pool that is Pooled will spin up and down hosts based on the environment's load.

### Task 2: Utilizing Application Packages (MSIX)

In this task, you will take an **MSIX package** created from the [MSIX packaging tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/tool-overview) and utilize the Azure portal to attach the MSIX package dynamically to AVD pools as users log in. MSIX Packages are disk images containing all files, configurations, and publication details needed to run supported applications that can be mounted by Windows systems on the fly to allow users to run the application without having to install the application on the host machine. By utilizing this technique, we can minimize the footprint and management needs of the AVD hosts while still using multiple applications on the systems without installing the applications permanently on the system.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Go to the **Storage Account** created in Exercise 3 for the FSLogix profiles already joined to Active Directory.

3. Select the **File shares** under data storage and select the share created for AVD files.

    ![This image shows you will open share for AVD File Share on the storage account.](images/avdFileShare.png "AVD File Share")

4. Ensure the **MSIX** directory you created earlier is there; if not, go back to Exercise 3, Tasks 4-6 and follow the steps to create it.

    >**Note:** Normally, in production, you would create an additional share for MSIX files and place the files there. You would need to make sure the share or container the MSIX files are in you follow the same steps you use for the FSLogix storage account and apply the appropriate permissions to them (users typically only need Read access) and make sure there is enough room to store them. We are placing it on the same share for this exercise for expediency and easier setup. It is not uncommon to have a central MSIX storage with permissions to each MSIX file based on groups assigned to the appropriate application and the MSIX repository used by multiple pools or deployments but ensure network connectivity and speed are kept consistent.

5. In a new tab in your browser, navigate to [https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Implementing-Azure-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/resources/VHD/](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Implementing-Azure-Virtual-Desktop-in-the-enterprise/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/resources/VHD/) and download AVD-MSIX.vhd.

6. Back in your storage account, upload the .VHD file to the MSIX folder.

    ![Select Upload file and upload the AVD-MSIX.vhd file to the file share.](images/uploadvhd.png "Upload AVD-MSIX.vhd")

7. The MSIX images on the VHD have been signed with Device Guard v2; for it to work, the root certificate needs to be installed on the servers used for publishing the apps. These servers don't have a public IP address, so we'll use the domain controller as a jump box to the app servers. First, create a remote desktop session to the domain controller.

8. Get the IP address from the first server in your remote app pool. It should be something like 10.1.0.8.

    ![The IP address of the first virtual machine in the remote app pool is highlighted.](images/ipappserver.png "The private IP address of the server")

9. On the domain controller, open Remote Desktop Connection and connect to the IP address of your first remote app server. You can use the avdadmin account you set up as a local admin when creating the server by entering **/avdadmin** for the username.

    ![The remote desktop connection on the domain controller with the IP address of the first remote app server is shown.](images/connecttoappserver.png "Remote desktop connection to the first remote app server")

10. Once you're logged into the first app server, open up Microsoft Edge and navigate to the following URL:

    ```text
    https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/microsoft%20enterprise%20identity%20verification%20root%20certificate%20authority%202020.crt
    ```

11. Open the downloaded certificate; this root certificate is needed to verify the MSIX packages. Select **Open** when the Security Warning is shown.

    ![In Microsoft Edge, select "open file" for the downloaded certificate.](images/downloadcertificate.png "Download the certificate from the URL in Edge")

    ![Select open from the Security Warning dialog that pops up.](images/opencertificate.png "Select Open in the Security Warning")

12. With the certificate opened, select **Install Certificate...**.

    ![Install the certificate by selecting Install Certificate...](images/installcertificate.png "Select Install Certificate...")

13. In the Certificate Import Wizard, select **Local Machine** for the Store Location. Then select **Next**.

    ![Choose Local Machine for the Storage location in the Import Wizard.](images/localmachinecertificate.png "Install the certificate in the Local Machine store")

14. On the wizard's next step, select **Place all certificates in the following store**. Then select **Browser** and **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**. Select **Next**.

    ![Choose to place all certificates in the following source, then browse to trusted root certification authorities.](images/trustedrootcertificate.png "Place the certificate in Trusted Root Certification Authorities")

15. Select **Finish**, and you'll see a dialog that the import was completed successfully.

    ![Select the Finish button to complete the certificate import.](images/finishcertificateinstall.png "Finish the Certificate import")

    ![Confirmation dialog that the certificate import was completed successfully.](images/succesfulcertimport.png "Succesful certificate import dialog")

16. Restart virtual machine. Repeat steps 8 - 16 on the second remote app server in the pool to import the certificate there also.

    >**Note**: In a larger image, this certificate import could be done in the Gold Image used for provisioning machines or incorporated into the provisioning of any new app servers in the pool.

17. Once the certificate has been successfully imported into both remote app servers and they have both been rebooted, navigate back to **Azure Virtual Desktop** in the Azure portal.

18. Select **Host Pools**, your remote app pool, **MSIX packages**, and then **+ Add**.

    ![In Azure Virtual Desktop, Host pools is highlighted, then the remote app pool. Followed by MSIX package and then the + Add button.](images/navigatetomsix.png "The links to click to navigate and add a new MSIX package")

19. In the MSIX image path, paste the file share path to your MSIX file. It should be in the format below. After pasting it in, wait a few seconds, and the rest of the dialog boxes should appear.

    ```text
    \\<storage account name>.file.core.windows.net\<share name>\msix\AVD-MSIX.vhd.
    ```

20. Select **Firefox** in the MSIX package, type **Firefox** into the Display Name, and set the State to **Active**. Then select **Add**.

    ![Fill in the path to the .vhd file, select the Firefox package, set the display name to Firefox, and make the app active.](images/addfirefoxpackage.png "Add the Firefox MSIX package")

21. Repeat steps 19 and 20 to add the NotePad++ package using the same path to the .vhd file and configure the settings for Notepad++ with the following settings.

    - MSIX image path: the path to the network share containing you .vhd file. The same path from step 19.
    - MSIX package: Select your NotepadPlusPlus package from the dropdown
    - Display name: Notepad++
    - State: Active

    ![Fill in the path to the .vhd file, select the Notepadd++ package, set the display name to Notepad++ and make the app active.](images/addnotepadpackage.png "Add the Notepad++ MSIX package")

22. In **Azure Virtual Desktop**, select **Application groups** under Manage, then select your **remoteapps** group.

23. Within your **remoteapps** group, select **Applications** and **+Add**.

    ![Select +Add to add a new remote app to your group.](images/addnewmsixapp.png "Add a new remote app")

24. Set the Application source to **MSIX package**, select **Firefox**, and provide an Application name of **Firefox**. Select Save.

    ![Set the application source to MSIX package, select the firefox application, name it Firefox and select the Save button.](images/addfirefoxapplication.png "Adding the Firefox application")

25. Repeat steps 23 and 24 to add the Notepad++ application.

26. You should have Firefox and Notepad++ added as available applications now.

    ![Firefox and Notepad++ are highlighted in the list of available applications. They have an application type of MSIX.](images/msixapplicationsadded.png "Firefox and Notepad++ added to the list of applications")

27. Go to the [AVD Web Client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient) (or AVD client if installed locally) and login as one of your end users.

28. Select the new application icon to launch the application (refresh the page if the new application does not show up).

    ![The notepad++ application published from the MSIX package is running in the browser.](images/notepadplusplus.png "Notepad++ running as a published app")

This application is now running on the host pool, although it is not installed on the host system. This allows the application to be updated by changing which MSIX package the application points to and the next time a user logs into the application.

### Task 3: Protect AVD with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service and deploy the endpoint protection via Azure. This enables all systems to be protected by the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service from potential vulnerabilities and alerts in the event of suspicious execution or activity.

>**Note:** This will require signing up for [Azure Defender trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/enable-azure-defender#to-enable-azure-defender-on-your-subscriptions-and-workspaces) on your subscription. If this is a Visual Studio subscription or you do not want to sign up for the time trial yet, you will need to wait and deploy this when you can sign up for the Azure Defender trial.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Open **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

    ![In this image, you are searching and navigating to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.](images/findAsc.png "Microsoft Defender for Cloud")

3. Select **Upgrade** on the **Getting started** page.

    ![The skip link is highlighted next to the Upgrade button. This bypasses the trial upgrade.](images/skipupgrade.png "Skip the 30 day trial upgrade")

4. Go to the **Workload protections** under the Cloud Security section.

5. Select **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to set up the trial edition of Azure Defender for your subscription.

    ![This image shows how to navigate to the Azure Defender section to enable the trial of Azure Defender.](images/enableAzureDefender.png "Enable Azure Defender")

6. Select Upgrade to start the 30-day trial upgrade you skipped earlier. You could also have upgraded from the initial Getting Started page.

    !["Select the Upgrade button to enroll in the 30-day trial of Microsoft Defender for Cloud enhance security features.](images/upgradedefender.png "Upgrade Microsoft Defender for Cloud")

7. Select **Install agents** to deploy the security agents to your virtual machines. You'll also see the count of unprotected resources in the entire subscription.

    !["The install agents button is highlighted that can be clicked to deploy the Microsoft Defender for Cloud agent to the unprotected VMs](images/installagents.png "Install agents")

8. Refresh the **Workload protections** screen. At the top, you should see all your resources in the subscription now fully covered.

    ![Workload protection shows Defender for Cloud coverage as 11 of 11 resources being fully protected.](images/fullprotectedresources.png "Fully covered workloads")

9. It can take some time for agents to deploy fully, but if you let it run for a while, you'll start seeing your resources show up in the Inventory.

    !["One of the application pool virtual machines is shown in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud inventory"](images/defenderinventory.png "Microsoft Defender for Cloud Inventory")

10. Depending on your AVD environment, you can deploy them to systems as they are added to your domain in the AVD OU by utilizing Group Policies using the [domain group policy scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/onboard-windows-10-multi-session-device?view=o365-worldwide#scenario-2-using-domain-group-policy). Another option when your host is not persistent or deployed from an image, is to use the instructions for [onboarding non-persistent VDI devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-endpoints-vdi?view=o365-worldwide).
